# To Do List

- [-] remove [LShip_Vendor_BlackMarket_Trader_A_Cargo_Railstar (LVLB:00086ECE)] from either RedMile_Always or BlackMarket_Random
    - no need, ShipVendorScript automatically removes duplicates during generation
- [-] remove [LShip_Vendor_Stroud_B_Privateer (LVLB:001EAA83)] from either [ShipVendorList_Staryard_Stroud_Random (ACTI:001F7679)] or [ShipVendorList_Staryard_Stroud_Always (ACTI:001F7680)]
    - no need, ShipVendorScript automatically removes duplicates during generation
- [X] add unique dataset to [NeonStroudStore_KioskVendor (NPC_:00151488)]
- [X] check that condition functions on Hammerhead/Falcon (Taiyo - Veronica Young) and Phalanx/Hoplite (Deimos - Nikau Henderson) work for low levels
- [X] check stroud privateer leveled ship base to see if it needs special lvl1 handling
- [X] clear out formlist 0x003 after testing
- [X] add version in SVF_Control.psc to version updater schema
- [X] add licensing to top of scripts
- [X] make it so that purchased unique ships are removed from the uniques list BEFORE the random list is de-duped
- [X] add patches
    - [X] save as esm:
        - [X] SVF-Deadalus-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-Dominion-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-IconicShips-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-LKShips-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-LowLandingPad-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-LowLandingPadUnlocked-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-OutpostVendorNewShips-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-StarvivalSpaceshipSystems-AllShipModulesUnlocked-OutpostOnly-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-StarvivalSpaceshipSystems-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-Generic-AllShipModulesUnlocked-AllShipVendors-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-Generic-AllShipModulesUnlocked-OutpostOnly-Patch.esp
        - [X] SVF-Generic-ShipVendors-Patch.esp
- [ ] add min and max limits to the number of "always" and "unique" ships? (default to -1, which means unlimited)
- [ ] add howto document/article that shows how to add vendors that utilize SVF
- [ ] add howto document/article that shows how to clean a plugin of dirty edits to ship vendor NPC_ records
- [-] Cache `GetFormID()` in ShipVendorScript (used in `_Log()`). (`GetFormID()` is a non-delayed native function, so it doesn't actually take much time, but i suspect there's possibly a tiny amount of time savings to be had by caching it)
    - profiling shows that for 132 calls to `GetFormID()` (and accompanying calls to `IntToHex()`) took less than 2ms. not worth worrying about.
- [ ] add threaded creation of ships to help with large lists
    - not going to be possible in a sane way until/unless the `GetFormFromFile()` function is fixed
- [ ] investigate ways to break 128-element barrier for generated ships, just in case (form list is likely the only way, but would possible open up script to corruption if record is overwritten)
- [X] when deleting ships from the vendor, sometimes it's not deleting them all. try getting all the linked refs of the landing pad marker and iterating through that list?
    - [-] check taiyo ship vendor for duplicated inventory issue
    - [-] xbox-only issue?
    - [-] make a terminal data slate to manually diagnose issue?
- [ ] add messaging to show when script is done processing. (block activation until done? how would this work when SVF hasn't been initialized yet?)
- [X] investigate issues with SVF after just coming out of unity
    - couldn't reproduce once i got around to testing - i suspect it was a symptom of another bug
- [X] clear player-sold ships upon inventory refresh
- [ ] change up terminology re capability vs compatibility. maybe "enhancement" instead of "capability"?
- [X] fix bug where "always" and "unique" ships (or maybe only "always" ships?) will fully respawn on OnLoad (due to the function that matches existing ships with what "should" be there)
- [X] fix mis-ordering of ships in list after partial refresh, probably going to have to remove linked ref and re-add
    - partial refreshes never seemed to work properly, so i removed them entirely
- [X] add patch for [The Den Astrodynamics](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8809)
- [-] add patch for [Rich Outpost Shipbuilder](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5492)
    - not going to support this for now - if `GetFormFromFile()` gets fixed for small/medium masters, will do this dynamically
- [ ] if `GetFormFromFile()` is fixed for small/medium masters, add in options like dynamic keyword addition at outpost ship builders (maybe regular ship services technicians as well?), always rich ship techs (outpost/regular)
