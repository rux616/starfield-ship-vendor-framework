Changelog
=========

v1.1.1
------
- Fixed issue where internal array was getting populated by SpaceshipReference objects referencing None
- Fixed issue where if the player purchased a ship from a vendor's "always" list, the vendor would always reset that list the next time it was loaded, instead of when the vendor was scheduled to reset
- Fixed issue where vendor could remain registered for OnPlayerLoadGame event even if not actually loaded
- Fixed issue where ships could be spuriously duplicated in the vendor menu by forcing a full (instead of partial) vendor refresh when a new ship is added to either of the vendor's "always" or "unique" lists
- Mitigated a potential race condition when vendor gets loaded
- Added patch for [Nexus] The Den Astrodynamics
