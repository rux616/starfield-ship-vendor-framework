Version: 1.5.0

Summary
-----
The system that Bethesda designed for selling ships is interesting, but it lacks a crucial element: Changeability. In vanilla Starfield, once a ship vendor has been loaded the first time, the list of ships they offer for sale is locked in forever until starting a new game (or new game plus).

That's where this mod comes in. I've designed a system such that mod authors can easily add ships for sale to the various ship vendors without either conflicting with other mods that do the same or requiring the set up of a script. It will also refresh the vendor's list of ships if a change is detected in the vendor's "always" or "unique" lists. (A ship vendor's inventory is composed of three lists: always a.k.a. priority, random, and unique.)

NOTE: The "random" ships are only regenerated every 7 days (by default).

Detailed instructions are included in the "How to Utilize the Ship Vendor Framework" article (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/articles/624) on Nexus Mods.

This is a limited version of the README. The full version can be found at the mod's page on Nexus Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10057), or in the GitHub project (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-ship-vendor-framework).

Load Order

- ShipVendorFramework.esm
- (SVF Capability Patches, if any)
- (SVF Generic Patches, if any)
- (SVF Compatibility Patches, if any)

Compatibility
-----
This mod alters NPCs that offer ship services, as well as some of the leveled lists for spaceships that vendors use. Any other mods that also alter those objects may conflict without patches.

Additionally, this mod alters 3 vanilla scripts, "OutpostShipbuilderMenuActivator", "ShipBuilderMenuActivator", and "ShipVendorScript". As a result, any other mod that alters any of those scripts by definition will conflict. This also means that when the game is updated, script changes by Bethesda will not be present in this mod until it is updated.

Mods that are known to conflict:
- "SGC Deadalus & Battlestar added to New Atlantis & Outpost Ship Vendor" by Rechi03 [Creations (https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/0993fb17-f960-4869-b417-485d129567f8/SGC_Deadalus__amp__Battlestar_added_to_New_Atlanti)]: Use SVF Capability Patch - Daedalus and Battlestar and one of the SVF Generic Patches that fits what you need.
