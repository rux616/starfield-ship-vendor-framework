Version: 1.1.0

Summary
-----
The system that Bethesda designed for selling ships is interesting, but it lacks a crucial element: Changeability. In vanilla Starfield, once a ship vendor has been loaded the first time, the list of ships they offer for sale is locked in forever.

That's where this mod comes in. I've designed a system such that mod authors can easily add ships for sale to the various ship vendors without either conflicting with other mods that do the same or requiring the set up of a script. It will also refresh the vendor's list of ships if a change is detected in the vendor's "always" or "unique" lists. (A ship vendor's inventory is composed of three lists: always a.k.a. priority, random, and unique.)

NOTE: The "random" ships are only regenerated every 7 days (by default).

Detailed instructions are included in the "How to Utilize the Ship Vendor Framework" article (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/articles/624) on Nexus Mods.

This is a limited version of the README. The full version can be found at the mod's page at Nexus Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10057), or in the GitHub project (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-ship-vendor-framework)

Load Order
----------
For best results, put this mod last in your load order, followed by other mods that have it as a master.

For patches, the load order should be as follows:
- ShipVendorFramework.esm
- (SVF Capability Patches, if any)
- (SVF Generic Patches, if any)
- (SVF Compatibility Patches, if any)

Compatibility
-----
This mod alters NPCs that offer ship services, as well as some of the leveled lists for spaceships that vendors use. Any other mods that also alter those objects may conflict without patches.

Additionally, this mod alters 2 vanilla scripts, "ShipVendorScript" and "OutpostShipbuilderMenuActivator". As a result, any other mod that alters either of (or both) those scripts by definition will conflict. This also means that when the game is updated, script changes by Bethesda will not be present in this mod until it is updated.

Known Issues

None
